## adding two numbers

- assuming increment and decrement to be primitive operations, implement a procedure to add two numbers
- peano arithmetic
- consider two ways to implement this procedure

```scheme
;; increment the sum of the decrement of x and y
(define (+ x y)
    if (= x 0)
        y
        (1+ (+ (-1+ x) y)))
```

```scheme
;; add the sum of the increment of x and the decrement of y
(define (+ x y)
    (if (= x 0)
        y
        (+ (1+ x) (-1+ y))))
```

- the programs accomplish the same thing, but the processes have different shapes
- consider the sum of 3 and 4
- think about the shapes the processes take

```scheme
;; using the first method
(+ 3 4)
(1+ (+ 2 4))
(1+ (1+ (+ 1 4)))
(1+ (1+ (1+ (0 + 4))))
(1+ (1+ (1+ 4)) ;; the sum of 0 and 4 is known
(1+ (1+ 5))
(1+ 6)
7
```

```scheme
;; using the second method
(+ 3 4) ;;|
(+ 2 5) ;;|
(+ 1 6) ;;| time
(+ 0 7) ;;|
7       ;;V
;;----------> space
```

- the first method takes space of the order of x, time of the order of x (recursion)
- the second method takes constant space (ignores the size of the numbers), time of the order of x (iteration)

- **an iteration is a system that has all of its state in explicit variables**
- besides the information stored in explicit variables, there is some information stored 'under the table' in the recursion model

## the fibonacci numbers

- start with 0 and 1
- every number after is the sum of the 2 numbers previous

```scheme
(define (fib x)
    (if (< x 2))
        x
        (+ (fib (- x 1)) (fib (- x 2))))
```

- consider fib 4
- fib 4 requires fib 3 and fib 2
- fib 3 requires fib 2 and fib 1
- fib 2 requires fib 1 and fib 0
- the process is exponential in time
- sub problems are calculated over and over

## sidenote

- programming is hard because you deal with variables and apply local rules to them
- you must consider any and all values these variables might take

## towers of hanoi

- the way to construct a recursive process is to believe
- suppose, i could move a n - 1 high tower from a spike to another
- then i could just move the one remaining disk and then move the n - 1 tower on top of it, which is a solved problem

```scheme
(define (move n from to spare) ;; move an n-high tower from 'from' to 'to' using a 'spare'
    (cond ((= n 0) "tower moved")
    (else (move (-1+ n) from spare to)
            (print-move from to)
            (move (-1+ n) space to from))))
```

- this works because you reduce the size of the problem at each step and the simplest form of the problem is solved
- this algorithm is also exponential in time

```scheme
(move 4 from to spare)
(move 3 from spare to)
(move 2 from to spare)
(move 1 from spare to)
(move )......
```

- could you convert this algorithm into one that is iterative in nature?
