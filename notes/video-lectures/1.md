# Lecture 1A: Overview and Introduction to Lisp

- computer science is a bad name, its not about computers, its not really a science
- we mean to study processes
- the constaints in building computer systems are the constraints of our minds
  - as opposed to building physical systems which are constained to limitations imposed by physical reality
  - ie, you may design a physical system with a billion parts, but it may not be feasible to implement such a system

- method for finding the fixed point of a function
  - ie, f(x) = x
  - general strategy might be to
    - start with a guess for x
    - keep applying f over and over until the result doesnt change very much

## topics covered in the course

1. black box abstraction
2. interfaces
3. meta linguistic abstraction

## introduction to lisp

- basic prefix notation
- (define a (* 5 5))
- (* a a)

```scheme
;; long form
(define square
    lambda (x) (* x x))

;; shorthand
(define (square x) (* x x))

(define (average x y)
    (/ (+ x y) 2))

(define (mean-square x y)
    (average (square x) (square y)))



;; conditional analysis
(define (abs x)
    (cond
      ((x < 0) (-x))
      ((= x 0) 0)
      ((> x 0) x)
    )
)
```

```scheme
(define (sq x) (* x x))

(define (abs x) (if (> x 0) x (- x)))

(define (avg x y) (/ (+ x y) 2))

(define (good-enough? x guess) (< (abs (- (sq guess) x)) 0.001))

(define (improve-guess x guess) (avg guess (/ x guess)))

(define (try x guess)
    (if (good-enough? x guess) guess
        (try x (improve-guess x guess))))

(define (find-root x) (try x 1.0))


(find-root 12.0)
```

- you could package all the internals of a black box inside that black box
- this is called block structure impl
